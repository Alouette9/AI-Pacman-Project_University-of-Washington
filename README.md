# AI-Pacman-Project_University-of-Washington
This is my implementation of Pacman project of UW CSS 382A.

• Developed a SAT-based AI agent to control Pacman using propositional logic and pycosat solver  
• Implemented successor state axioms and planning functions to simulate agent decision-making  
• Built logic-based path planners (positionLogicPlan, foodLogicPlan) using DFS and logical constraints  
• Applied SLAM techniques to enable the agent to localize and map unknown environments in real-time  
• Gained hands-on experience with symbolic logic, agent planning, uncertainty modeling, and Python debugging
